# Name Generator

## About
I wanted something to practice testing with Jest and figured that a name generator would work well. 

This is based off of those memes where there's an image saying that it'll tell you your [pirate, supehero, etc.] name given things like your first initial, your birth month, etc. [(example).](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/545204-character-name-generators) 

## Changes / Improvements
I have plenty ideas for making this bigger, but I'll be realistic--I have other projects that I am more interested in working on and this will have served its purpose even before I get to styling. I'll go ahead and add style it just to make it "finished", but I don't think I'll be working on this more after that. 

If you see a very basic name generator for just one name, that's the project.
